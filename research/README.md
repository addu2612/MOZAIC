# Research

Place lightweight experiment notes, evaluation plans, and (optionally) notebooks here.

Recommended conventions:
- Keep datasets out of git (store in external bucket and document retrieval).
- Keep notebook outputs cleared before commit.
- Add short markdown notes describing each experiment.
